Setting up document structure:

Design challenge:
    Remebering the order of which things to affect (is it the parent or child?).
    Still stumbling on distinguing between ID (#) and Class (.), and so, spent time 
    going 'why isn't this affecting _____?' , 'oh, that doens't work either', 
    'ohhhhhh, I used wrong syntax?!'

    Or miswriting not catching syntax and naming convention miswrites. I spent alot of time
    going 'what am I doing?', 'why isn't this working?', 'nothing is happening?!', and then,
    realizing that I am calling script instead of scripts, or short_URL when the console is 
    saying that short_url is what populates my shortened link. Or, I decided to rename some
    things in my HTML, and then, I looked at my script with deep confusion for, like, 30 minutes.

    This is my second time building an entire website, and if the accessibility 
    design SBA was any indicator, making entire websites with elements and components that get along
    isn't my strong suit. That being said, was pretty excited to learn you can use negative numbers
    to affect the postition of things, so I was able to get my url Shortner to "sit" inbetween the 
    Hero section and the main section. Solid WIN.

    Also, what is jetpack?


    ((This is for me, as I was trying to distinguish between justify content, align items, 
    space around vs space evenly, calling upon the mighty clipboard, and making modules. Good reads))

API fetch challenge:

    Ummm, everything. Jameka was very kind to suggest an URL shortner API she used (spoo.me). So,
    it was cool learning how to make API keys and hiding them into my files, and getting it called up.
    But still very overwhelming since I did not successfully accomplish this for my SBA6. Also, I could
    not figure out how to target specific information, but I was informed that the URL search bar in 
    a mighty tool!

Publishing and demo challenge:

    Okay, so publishing to Netlify, not a problem, especially since it sounds like, if I understood 
    correctly, that the env file wasn't working for me, and so I could go ahead and skip that and just
    focus on publishing. But, I'm sad that it doesn't work the way it is supposed to. Would like to fix
    that in the future. That being said, I'm still confused on what "demo" means here. I added the link, 
    but didn't see a demo link populate when I published, so hope I got this correct.

    Thanks!
